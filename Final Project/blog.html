        <h2>Large solar dawns in Michigan, but residential incentives may sunset</h2>
        <h3>By Colleen Otte</h3>
        <p>
Michigan’s solar future is so bright that advocates say you might just have to wear shades.
Assuming all goes as planned, Michigan may soon see a solar project nearly 50 times larger than its largest existing installation.
The state’s biggest solar project now operating is a 1.1 megawatt generator owned by DTE Energy in Ann Arbor, said John Sarver, president of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association.
“But there are much bigger projects planned, including 10 megawatts at Michigan State University and 20 megawatts with the Lansing Board of Water & Light,” Sarver said.</p>

        <h4>Expanding wildland-urban interface creates new land challenges</h3>
        <h5>By Colleen Otte</h5>
        <p>
A stretch of lakefront. Expanses of forest on either side. Abundant wildlife.
These are characteristics that most people view as ideal for a family cottage or a retirement home.
They are formally known as the wildland-urban interface and are detailed in a recently released U.S. Forest Service science publication.
“The atlas brings together maps of the whole U.S. and each of the states that show where the wildland-urban interface is,” said Susan Stewart, one of the book’s authors and a staff scientist at the University of Wisconsin.</p>

        <h6>Bird sounds signal Great Lakes forest health</h4>
        <h7>By Colleen Otte</h7>
        <p>
When faced with assessing Great Lakes forest health, Wisconsin researchers figured this task is for the birds.
That’s not to say the status of forests isn’t worthy of consideration, of course. But birds reveal a great deal about the condition of a forest ecosystem, and form the basis of a new study “Sensitivity of breeding birds to the ‘human footprint’ in western Great Lakes forest landscapes.”
“Birds are great indicators of what’s happening in the forest,” said Nicholas Miller, one of the authors of the study recently published in the Ecological Society of America’s Ecosphere journal.</p>
