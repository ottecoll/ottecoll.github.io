      <h1>Hi! I'm Colleen, and as a journalism and environmental studies student, I strive to be "Uno con el Mundo": One with the World. Check out how!</h1>
      <p>Visual communicator: journalist, photographer, designer, artist.
        Environmentalist at heart.

        Senior at Michigan State University, student of the world.

Grew up in beautiful Northern Michigan, five minutes from five lakes, where my love for the environment and capturing photographs came naturally. Throughout my education, I also gained a strong passion for writing and reporting, graphic design and art. </p>
